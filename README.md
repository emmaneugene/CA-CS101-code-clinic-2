# A brief introduction to programming in C

## Examples

This repo has many C programs which you can compile and run as examples. There is
a `Makefile` that simplifies this process.

- To compile: `make SRC=<filepath>`

- To run (compilation is handled automatically): `make run SRC=<filepath>`

- To delete: `make clean SRC=<filepath>`

Where `<filepath>` is an absolute or relative path to the source file (.c).

### 1. Hello world

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  printf("Hello, world!\n");
}
```

- What's the significance of:
  - `#include`?
  -  `stdio.h`?
  -  `main`?
  -  `int argc, char *argv[]`?
- How do you run this program? What are the steps involved, and why do we need them?

### 2. Variables, datatypes, conventions

- Basic datatypes: `char`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`

- The `sizeof` operator tells you how much space the datatype occupies up in *bytes*

- It's possible to 'convert' one datatype into another with typecasting

- Variables can be *declared*, *assigned* or *initialized*

- Naming conventions in C:

  - use alphanumeric characters, `_` as a substitute for whitespace

  - lowercase for local variables
  - uppercase for constants
  - first character should not be a number

### 3. Operators and precedence

- Similar to BODMAS in mathematics, operators in C also have their own levels precedence
- Find out more about precedence [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_operators_precedence.htm)
- If unsure, it never hurts to use parentheses ()

### 4. Conditionals

- Using boolean logic to control the execution specific blocks of code
- De Morgan's theorem (prove it for yourself with a truth table)
- Short-circuiting operators:  `||` ,  `&&`

### 5. Loops

- Repeating blocks of code until a certain stopping condition is met (still a boolean)
- What's the difference between `for`, `while`, `do while`? Is it possible to convert one into the other?
- Nested loops

### 6. Functions and scope

- Distinguish between function *declaration* vs *implementation*

```c
// Declaration
void common_factors(int x, int y);

// Implementation
void common_factors(int x, int y) {
  int lowest = x < y ? x : y;

  for (int i = 2; i <= lowest; i++) {
    if (x % i == 0 && y % i == 0) {
      printf("Common factor: %d\n", i)
    }
  }
}
```

- Understand the concept of a *function frame*, *stack* and *heap*
- Understand the general intuition behind recursion

### 7. Arrays, pointers and memory allocation

- What is an array? What makes it useful?
  - Contiguous block of memory for storing a certain datatype

- What is a pointer? What makes it useful
- null reference
- Passing by *reference* vs passing by *value*
- Visualizing using memory state diagrams
- `malloc`, `calloc` and `free` - how do they work?

### 8. Strings

- All strings are `char` arrays

- How do we know when a string terminates?

- Strings declared using `*` are immutable

  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>

  void fun(char *str) {
    printf("%c\n", str[1]);
    str[1] = 'a';
  }

  int main(void) {
    char *mystr = "Hello"; // constant, immutable, read-only
    char mystr2[] = "Testing"; // mutable

    fun(mystr2);
    printf("%s\n", mystr);
    printf("%s\n", mystr2);
  }
  ```



### 9. Structs

- Logical grouping of datatypes, allowing for greater abstraction
- Foundation for Object-Oriented Programming (your next course)

### 10. Useful libraries, tips, tools and resources

#### Libraries

- `string.h`

- `math.h`
- `stdlib.h`
- `limits.h`

- Feel free to make your own as well!

#### Tips

- Get comfortable with the command line

- Read and understand your compile and runtime errors

- Write comments to structure your logic, or as a placeholder for future code

- Pay attention to variable names, especially as code gets more complex

- Handle corner cases first

  ❌ Don't do this

  ```c
  int main(void) {
    if (!/*corner case*/) {
      // Main body
    }
    // Handle corner case
  }
  ```

  ✅ Do this

  ```c
  int main(void) {
    if (/*corner case*/) {
      // Handle corner case
      return
    }

    // Main body
  }
  ```

- Revisit old problems and come up with better solutions. Be able to explain the tradeoffs involved with each one
