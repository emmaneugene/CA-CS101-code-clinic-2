/*
Understand the 3 elements of a for-loop:
1. Initialisation of variable (need not be int, can be char or double as well)
2. Condition (if false, break out of the loop) - this implies that the loop will run forever is the condition is not made false
3. Increment

Understand the concept of variable scopes
(under which context variables are garbage collected)
